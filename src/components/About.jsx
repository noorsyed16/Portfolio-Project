            <p>Hi! I’m a passionate and motivated Software Engineering student at the University
               of Calgary. My experiences in technical projects, teaching, and mentoring have 
               helped me grow as a collaborative leader, enabling me to tackle challenges while 
               supporting others. I enjoy combining technical skills with creative problem-solving 
               to deliver meaningful results. I’m a fast learner and am excited to apply what I learn 
               in school to real-world opportunities. Scroll down to explore my projects, skills, 
               and experiences!
